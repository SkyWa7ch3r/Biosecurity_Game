    Added to the manage.py Ben and Mark will not have different logins and different passwords. It will run the process multiple times according to oTree Developer Chris, however
    from my own tests it seems to work. So I will try it on the main server now.
    The Participant labels can be added by Ben and Mark, just by adding "?participant_label=<FirstName>_<Surname>" to the end of a session link,
    not only will this fill in the participant label, but also allow a session link to be only used once.

    Chat app has been completed with filtering for the words.
    It will leave a message for all users in the group to see to contact the coordinator in cases of profanity.
    Issue fixed where it would show messages between different groups in the same session, now rooms are created on a session and by group basis.
    The Profanity Folder has been created and will be hidden on the server. A README.txt is included advising that the words maybe offensive.
    We have left a line saying that we do not take responsibility for any offense taken to you or to any party.

    Updated the bots for the lottery game to fit the new quesitioner questions. Updated the column names for the lottery_data.csv file to a more intuitive naming conevention. a_right, a_wrong, don't accurately depict the way the game works so 'right' and 'wrong' were changed to 'best' and 'worst'. Changes were made to models.py and views.py to account for this change. Added lines in models.py that allow for a set outcome of the lottery to occur for testing purposes.

    The Cost, protection slider, revenue and upkeep all now work as expected (or at least it so appears).
    This was done using a participant variable inside the player class which keeps the value in between rounds. Allowing us to change this according to payoffs in each round.
    Neat!

    The basic automated bots for the Lottery Game have been made, for how these work, look into the comments and Documentation.
    The Session configs have been chnaged so that the Lottery_Test uses Browser Bots, I should put in a session for without browser_bots
    The CSV folder now has the csv files that the Lottery Game uses, the models.py now directs to these in order to open the csv files and read them.
    This allows an easy location for editing and locating the csv files.

    Changed the session_config so it can now be edited via a .csv file within the folder CSV named session_config.
    It will assign the values based on the Session Variable column within the .csv file.
    This will allow full control of the session variables and will deliver full control of the experiment.

Submits is a list used to hold the answer from each question that can be indexed over to find each players answer for each row.
    Rearranged the payoff logic such that is now correctly selects the right payment for each player
    Views now correctly displays the payoff for each individual player

    Tested that the games go from Lottery to Biosecurity to Results
    The Group Logic has been added, now you can set however many participants and based on the session an admin chooses, it will arrange the groups. If the number of participants is not a multiple of the number of groups, it will take 1 player from each group until the last group is full.
    The static root changes are from doing the otree collectstatic, which is required to run the program.
