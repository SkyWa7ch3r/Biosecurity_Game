# Biosecurity Game

This project started as a student project for 6 University students from The University of Western Australia (UWA) in 2016. The aim was to convert an old game made
in ztree and convert it over to oTree. oTree is a platform for creating web-based interactive multiplayer games, after 2016 the project was updated with new features
and at the time keeping up with the latest oTree versions.

Since 2018 this project has been maintained on a Bitbucket repository, however it's now time to move it over to GitHub, and run it on a new system. The current system
is running on an old version of oTree and an older version of Python (3.6), the end goal is to eventually move this project over to oTree's newest version (>= 5.5).

# TODO

- [X] Cleaned up the repository
- [X] Add new environment.yaml and requirements.txt files
- [ ] Move all instructions and documentation to readthedocs
- [ ] Create docker containers and docker compose for the new server
- [ ] Update the existing project to oTree >= 5.5 with the sample games added, alongside the original project.
