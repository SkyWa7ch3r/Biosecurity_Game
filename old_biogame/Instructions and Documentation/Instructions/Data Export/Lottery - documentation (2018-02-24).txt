This is the Lottery Game where participants have 3 Play Panels, each panel containing upto 15 games, 
where each game will have two options A or B, option A generally being the less risky lottery game to play, and B being 
the more risky option, however B has much higher reward when a participant wins on option B. The game will allow you as an administrator 
to assess how risk aversive your group(s) is/are. Please refer to the Administration Instructions for more details on the Lottery Game.

            If this subsession is repeated (i.e. has multiple rounds), this
            field stores the position (index) of this subsession, among subsessions
            in the same app.
            For example, if a session consists of the subsessions:
            [app1, app2, app1, app1, app3]
            Then the round numbers of these subsessions would be:
            [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
