			<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
			<p> <strong>Hi, your name throughout the game will be <i>{{ name }}.</i></strong></p>
			<p> Please read through these instructions carefully. If you have any questions please contact one of the administrators.
				You are about to take part in an experiment about collective decision-making related to risky choices. This experiment gives you an opportunity to earn money. How much you earn depends partly on your decisions, partly on the decisions of others, and partly on chance. 	
			<p>	
				<strong>The Basics</strong> </br>
				<p>
				The game will consist of 15 rounds with multiple stages per round. You will start the game with ${{ starting_funds }}, each round you will need to pay
				${{ upkeep }} for the production of the crops. In the case of there being no incursions from Biosecurity Threats, everyone will have a revenue of ${{ revenue }}
				and the amount of protection you put towards Biosecurity Threats will be taken away from the revenue.</p>
				The maximum amount of protection you can put towards Biosecurity Threats in each round is ${{ max_protection }}. In the case where an incursion occurs, everyone will lose the rounds crops and all revenue is lost,
				resulting in a loss for that round. The loss will come from the production of crops and the amount of protection you provided those crops against the threat.
				The chance of incursion will be decided from the amount of protection every group member decides to provide. Even if a majority of the group members provide
				a relatively high amount of protection against biosecurity threats, an incursion may still occur due to the way the joint probability of incursion is calculated.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>How the Joint Probability is calculated:</i><br>
				In a round where there are 2 players and each player contributes an effort of 90% towards protection against Biosecurity Threats 
				to give a 90% chance that they're not the source of the incursion.<br>
				Then<br>
				Probability of Incursion = 1 - Player 1's Probability x Player 2's Probability<br>
				Probability of Incursion = 1 - (0.9) x (0.9)<br>
				Probability of Incursion = 1 - 0.81<br>
				Probability of Incursion = 0.19 or 19%<br>
				<br>
				In another scenario, again with 2 players, 1 player contributes 90% and another player contributes 10%<br>
				Probability of Incursion = 1 - (0.9) x (0.1)<br>
				Probability of Incursion = 0.91 or 91%<br>
				</p>
			</p>

				<Strong>The Stages</strong>
			</p>
				{% if dynamic_finances %}
					<p>
					<b><i> Dynamic Finances has been turned on, you will receive a different amount of revenue, production costs and maximum amounts of protection per round</b></i>
					</p>
				{% endif %}
				{% if pledge %}
					<p>
					<b><i>Group Pledging</b></i></br>
					In this stage, you will use a slider to decide an ideal target the group should strive for. This target is done on a scale of 0 - 100%, and represents
					the chance of not having an incursion that the group should strive for. Once you and your group members have individually decided what you believe to
					be an ideal target (the chance of no incursion as a group), everyone's ideal target will be taken into an equation, which will result in an overall
					Group Target, the chance of no incursion that your group as a whole has decided to strive for.</br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<b><i>Individual Pledging</b></i></br>
					In this stage, you and your group members will see the Group Target. Using the slider you will pledge how much you will spend on protection against
					Biosecurity Threats for the next {{ plooper }} rounds. This individual pledge will be shown in currency, below this will be a calculation
					of probability that you will not be the source of the incursion based upon the amount of protection you are willing to provide.
					To remind you, this game is based on <i>joint probability</i>, your individual probability is not an indicator of the
					group's probability of incursion, even if other players do the same amount of protection. Keep this in mind when making an individual
					pledge (if you're cooperative, you want to pledge above the Group Target to help ensure the group meets its target).
					</p>
				{% endif %}
				{% if Papproval %}
					<p>
					<b><i>Approval Based on Individual Pledges</b></i></br>
					In this stage you will have the opportunity to show your approval of your group member's individual pledges as well as your own. The approval is done based
					on a scale of -6 to 6.</br>-6 being Strongly Dissaprove</br>6 being Strongly Approve</br> The closer the number is to 6, the more you approve of that player's individual
					pledge. On this page you will also be reminded of the Group Target to compare that with everybody's individual pledge.
					</p>
				{% endif %}
				<p>
					<b><i>Deciding Your Protection</b></i></br>
					In this stage, using the slider, you will decide how much protection to provide against Biosecurity Threats.
					Below the slider, it will show the cost of protection you're providing.
					{% if calc %}
						Below the cost of protection it will show the chance of you not being the source of incursion in accordance to how much
						protection you are providing. To remind you, this game is based on <i>joint probability</i>, your individual probability is not an indicator of the
						group's probability of incursion, even if other players do the same amount of protection.
					{% endif %}
					{% if dynamic_finances %}
						The maximum amount of protection you can provide per round will be different. The revenue and the cost of production will also differ.
					{% else %}
						The maximum amount of protection you can provide per round will be ${{ max_protection }}, the cost of production will be ${{ upkeep }} and
						the amount of revenue to gain in the event no incursion occurs is ${{ revenue }}.
					{% endif %}
					{% if pledge %}
						In the main round you will again see the Group Target, and each person's individual pledges (including your own) and how many rounds there are until the next pledging stage.
						{% if Papproval %}
							After selecting the approval of everyone's pledges, the groups approval of each player will be shown. The group's approval
							of each player is the average of everyone's approval of that player.
						{% endif %}
						{% if Capproval %}
							After completing a round where you gave an approval of everyone's Contribution over the last {{ clooper }} rounds, the group's
							approval of each player will be shown. The Group's approval of each player is the average of everybodies approval of the player's contributions.
							More information will be provided below in <i>Approval based On Contribution</i>.
						{% endif %}
					{% endif %}	
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>The Results</b></i></br>
					In this stage you will be reminded of the revenue, cost of production and the amount of protection you provided and whether an incursion occured.
					{% if monitoring %}
						Alongside your own protection, you will also be shown how much protection everybody else provided. Pay attention to this carefully as it
						will allow you to possibly figure out who was the source of the incursion, which could be helpful in other stages of the game.
					{% endif %}
				</p>
					{% if Capproval %}
						<p>
						<b><i>Approval based On Contribution</b></i></br>
						This stage will show up every {{ clooper }} rounds. It will show the results from the last {{ clooper }} rounds, the results will include
						the Group Target, everybody's individual pledges and the amount protection they provided from the last {{ clooper }} rounds. With this information, you will
						decide your approval of that player on a scale of -6 to 6.</br>
						-6 being Strongly Dissaprove</br>
						6 being Strongly Approve</br>
						The closer the number is to 6, the more you approve of the player's contributions. As mentioned in <i>Deciding Your Protection</i>, the Group's Approval of each player will be the average
						of everyone's approval of that player, and the Group's Approval of each player will be displayed in the Deciding Your Protection Stage.
						</p>
