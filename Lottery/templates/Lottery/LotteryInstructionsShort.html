				<h3><b>Please Refer to the Printed Sheet Given to you<b></h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><u><h3>How the Game works</u></strong></h3>
				There are a total of 35 Games, 3 Play Panels and two options, A or B.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to determine what prize what shall receive from the Lottery Game, the game randomly chooses one PLAY PANEL of the possible three.
				The number of the PLAY PANEL will be shown at the top of the page under the heading "Virtual Lottery Game Panel X of 3", X being the PLAY PANEL number. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After randomly choosing a PLAY PANEL, from this PLAY PANEL it will randomly choose <b>one</b> of the games inside that PLAY PANEL. This will be your <b>paying game</b>.
				The Game Number is shown the left hand side of each panel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For each game you will have an option of A or B. A number will be chosen between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10), 
				it is this number that will determine your prize based on the option you chose.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Chance of you winning the said prize for each option (A or B) is displayed the right hand side of each option given in terms of probability.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, Look at the image below:
			</p>
				<img height="150" width="800" src="{% static "Lottery/lottery.jpg" %}"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				In this scenario a PLAY PANEL was chosen with Games 1 to 3.<br>
				The Game Number that was randomly chosen as the paying game was <b>2</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Game <b>2</b>, you have (just like every game) two options:<br>
				Option <b>A</b>, which has a <i>30%</i> of you winning $40 and a <i>70%</i> of winning $10.<br> 
				Option <b>B</b>, which has a <i>10%</i> of you winning $75 and a <i>90%</i> of winning $5.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Game chooses a random number between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10).
			</p>
			<p>
				If you had chosen Option A, then<br>
				If the randomly chosen number had been 1 to 3, you would have won $40<br>
				If the randomly chosen number had been 4 to 10, you would have won $10
			</p>
			<p>
				If you had chosen Option B, then<br>
				If the randomly chosen number had been 1, you would have won $75<br>
				If the randomly chosen number had been 2 to 10, you would have won $5
